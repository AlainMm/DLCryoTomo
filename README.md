**Hybrid neural network architecture**.
In this model, we extend semantic segmentation methods to automate the detection of membranes and vesicles in tomograms. This is achieved through a hybrid neural network architecture that combines the features of several architectures such as U-Net, DeepLab, SegNet, Gated-SCNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Most importantly, we incorporate spatial and channel attention mechanisms, dilated convolutions, edge attention, and specific loss functions to enhance fine segmentation details.
